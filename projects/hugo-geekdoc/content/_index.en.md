During our DevOps journey, we have used a multitude tools and infrastructure,
and encountered many problems.

Sometimes we have failed to document certain situations, thinking that we We
wouldn't encounter these problems anymore.

However, recently I have been working with different startups and I have
realized that I found myself repeating the same tasks.

This is why I decided to create this documentation site to record the problems
we face and their solutions.
